# IAM

Each week will focus on one or more AWS component. Students will read about the component (white papers and/or developer documentation), complete hands on exercises and write a one page report. The one page report will include a discussion of the performance and scalability characteristics of the component and its various failure modes. Students and instructor will meet each week to review the one page report and discuss the weeks work.
